# TimeFriction
TimeFriction is a lightweight command-line tool that analyzes time overruns on individual tasks and identifies the most likely source of execution friction. Instead of tracking everything, it focuses on one task at a time, diagnoses where time leaked, and enforces a single corrective rule for the next execution cycle.
The tool treats time loss as an engineering problem, not a motivation problem. By converting overruns into explicit causes and constraints, TimeFriction creates a tight feedback loop that improves estimation, containment, and execution consistency over time.
Designed for people who want practical correction, not analytics dashboards.
